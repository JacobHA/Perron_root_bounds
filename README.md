# Perron root bounds
Calculate bounds on the Perron (dominant) eigenvalue of nonnegative matrices

# Use cases:
To quickly estimate/bound the dominant eigenvalue can be useful in:
- Topological entropy
- Spectral graph theory (graph properties such as connectivity, coloring, etc.)
- Predominant evolution of dynamical systems
