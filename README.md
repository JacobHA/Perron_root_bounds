# Perron root bounds
Calculate bounds on the Perron (dominant) eigenvalue of nonnegative matrices

# Use cases:
To quickly estimate/bound the dominant eigenvalue can be useful in:
\item Topological entropy
\item Spectral graph theory (graph properties such as connectivity, coloring, etc.)
\item Predominant evolution of dynamical systems
